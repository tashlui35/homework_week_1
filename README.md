### When was the company incorporated?

### Who are the founders of the company?

Block inc. was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey in Chicago, Illinois. 

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea for Block Inc came about when a group of tech enthusiasts and blockchain experts noticed the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, but also recognized that the accessibility and usability of these digital assets was still very limited. They saw that many people were interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, but were hesitant due to the complexity of buying, storing and managing these assets.

They understood that blockchain technology had the potential to revolutionize the way financial transactions were conducted, but also realized that the average person lacked the technical knowledge to fully leverage these benefits. They saw an opportunity to bridge this gap and make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public.

Using their expertise, they designed a platform that allowed users to buy, sell, and store their cryptocurrencies with ease. They also integrated additional features, such as a user-friendly interface, a mobile application, and 24/7 customer support, to maximize the user experience.

Block Inc's founders were determined to make the platform not only accessible but also secure. They implemented several security measures to protect users' assets and data from theft or hacking attempts.

The result was a game-changing platform that bridged the gap between traditional finance and the digital world, making it easier for people to participate in the growing cryptocurrency market. Today, Block Inc continues to innovate and expand its offerings, building on the founding vision of accessibility, usability, and security for all.

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Block Inc aims to solve the current financial problem of friction in cross-border payments and reduce dependence on intermediaries. Block Inc is striving to provide a platform that allows individuals and institutions to transact globally with secure, fast, and low-cost payments.

The problem of high transaction costs and delays in cross-border payments has been a long-standing issue faced by many individuals and organizations. The traditional banking system's cross-border payments are costly, inefficient, and time-consuming, especially for developing countries where financial inclusion is a significant problem. As a result, such countries rely heavily on costly intermediaries like money transfer operators and foreign exchange providers.

The need for intermediaries is due to the lack of a standardized global payment network to handle cross-border transactions. This lack of standardization leads to significant inefficiencies, making cross-border payments slow and costly. Block Inc aims to bridge this gap by providing a universal payment infrastructure that allows individuals and institutions to transact globally without intermediaries, ensuring fast, secure, and low-cost payments.

Another problem Block Inc is trying to solve is the high volatility and instability of traditional fiat currencies. The current financial system has significant issues, including inflation, currency depreciations, and government interferences, which lead to increased economic uncertainty. Block Inc's platform leverages blockchain technology to offer a stable digital asset backed by fiat currencies, providing users with an alternative to traditional currencies.

Block Inc is also addressing the problem of financial exclusion by providing a low-cost and accessible payment infrastructure that enables individuals and small businesses in developing countries to participate actively in global trade. Financial inclusion is a critical problem as over 1.7 billion adults globally are unbanked, making it difficult for them to participate in the global economy.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Block Inc.'s intended customer is any individual or organization interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The company's primary goal is to make it easier for people to access, invest and use cryptocurrencies by developing user-friendly applications and platforms.

Block Inc. aims to create a seamless experience for its customers by bridging the gap between the traditional financial world and the cryptocurrency industry. Therefore, their intended customers include individuals who want to send and receive cryptocurrency payments quickly and securely, as well as traders and investors looking to buy and sell digital assets in a safe and efficient manner.

Additionally, Block Inc. targets businesses that are interested in integrating blockchain technology into their operations. The company provides blockchain consulting services to help businesses understand how blockchain can streamline their processes, reduce costs, and improve security.

Block Inc.'s customer base also includes software developers who are building decentralized applications using blockchain technology. The company offers developer tools and protocols that enable the creation of decentralized apps with streamlined processes and smart contract capabilities. 

However, it can be assumed that the market size of Block Inc.'s customer base relies on the company's target audience and their buying capacity. Block Inc. is a blockchain technology company that provides enterprise-level solutions for businesses in various industries. Therefore, its customer base could include large multinational corporations, mid-sized companies, and small businesses. The size of the market can vary widely depending on the types of industries Block Inc. is targeting and the variety of products and services they provide.

The market size of Block Inc.'s customers can also be influenced by the competition in the blockchain technology industry. With the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, many other companies are offering similar solutions. Therefore, Block Inc.'s marketing strategies and customer outreach efforts can also affect their market size.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?) 

While many of its competitors offer blockchain-based solutions, Block Inc has developed a blockchain-based platform that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with cloud computing. This allows for faster, more secure, and more versatile solutions than what its competitors can offer.

One of the key advantages of Block Inc's platform is its scalability. The platform is designed to be highly flexible and can be easily customized to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes. This makes it an ideal solution for small businesses, startups, and large enterprises alike.

Another advantage of Block Inc's platform is its reliability. The platform is built using the latest technology and is designed to be highly resistant to hacking and other cyber threats. This ensures that businesses can rely on the platform to keep their data safe and secure at all times.

Finally, Block Inc's platform is highly customizable and very easy to use. The platform can be easily tailored to meet the specific needs of businesses in different industries as it comes with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for businesses to get started using the platform. This means that businesses can start using the platform quickly and easily, without the need for extensive training or technical expertise and makes it an ideal solution for businesses that need highly specialized solutions that are not available from off-the-shelf software.
